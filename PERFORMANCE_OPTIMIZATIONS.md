# Performance Optimizations Applied

## Summary
This document outlines the performance optimizations applied to improve application speed and reduce memory usage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Unused Code
- **File**: `client/src/pages/enquiry-detail.tsx`
  - Removed unused imports: `Edit`, `Trash2` from lucide-react
  - Removed unused import: `EnquiryForm` component
  - Removed unused state: `showEditDialog`
  - Removed large commented-out code blocks (100+ lines)

### 2. Optimized React Query Configuration
- **File**: `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts`
  - Changed `staleTime` from `Infinity` to `5 minutes` for better data freshness
  - Added `gcTime` (garbage collection time) of `10 minutes`
  - Implemented smart retry logic that doesn't retry on 4xx client errors
  - Added exponential backoff for retry delays
  - Optimized mutation retry behavior

### 3. Enhanced Caching Strategy
- **File**: `client/src/pages/enquiry-detail.tsx`
  - Added specific `staleTime` and `gcTime` for different data types:
    - Suppliers: 10 minutes stale, 30 minutes GC (rarely change)
    - Customers: 5 minutes stale, 15 minutes GC (moderate changes)
    - Referral customers: 5 minutes stale, 15 minutes GC

### 4. Created Performance Monitoring Tools
- **File**: `client/src/hooks/useOptimizedQueries.ts`
  - Added query prefetching utilities
  - Implemented cache optimization functions
  - Added unused cache clearing functionality

- **File**: `client/src/utils/performance.ts`
  - Created performance monitoring system
  - Added query time tracking
  - Implemented cache hit rate monitoring
  - Added memory usage tracking
  - Automatic performance logging in development

## Performance Benefits

### Memory Usage
- **Reduced bundle size** by removing unused imports and dead code
- **Better garbage collection** with optimized `gcTime` settings
- **Memory leak prevention** with automatic cleanup of old metrics

### Network Performance
- **Reduced API calls** through better caching strategies
- **Faster data loading** with prefetching capabilities
- **Smart retry logic** prevents unnecessary network requests

### User Experience
- **Faster page loads** due to optimized caching
- **Reduced loading states** with prefetched data
- **Better responsiveness** with performance monitoring

## Cache Strategy

### Data Type Caching
- **Reference Data** (Suppliers, Customers): 10-30 minutes
- **Transactional Data** (Enquiries, Quotations): 5-15 minutes
- **Real-time Data**: 1-5 minutes

### Query Optimization
- **Prefetching**: Common data is prefetched in background
- **Smart Invalidation**: Only invalidate related queries
- **Background Refetching**: Disabled to prevent unnecessary requests

## Monitoring

The application now includes performance monitoring that tracks:
- Query execution times
- Cache hit rates
- Memory usage
- Network request patterns

In development mode, performance metrics are logged every 30 seconds to help identify bottlenecks.

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Performance**: Use the built-in performance monitoring to track improvements
2. **Regular Cleanup**: Run cache cleanup periodically for optimal memory usage
3. **Prefetch Strategy**: Implement prefetching for commonly accessed data
4. **Bundle Analysis**: Regularly analyze bundle size to identify unused dependencies

## Files Modified

- `client/src/pages/enquiry-detail.tsx` - Removed unused code, optimized queries
- `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` - Enhanced caching configuration
- `client/src/hooks/useOptimizedQueries.ts` - New performance utilities
- `client/src/utils/performance.ts` - New performance monitoring

## Next Steps

1. Apply similar optimizations to other pages
2. Implement lazy loading for heavy components
3. Add service worker for offline caching
4. Consider implementing virtual scrolling for large lists
