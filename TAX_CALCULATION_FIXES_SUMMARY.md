# Tax Calculation Fixes and Enhancements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive tax calculation fixes and UI enhancements implemented across the TRADIX application to ensure accurate VAT calculations and improved user experience.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Inconsistent Tax Calculations

## Test Results

### Tax Calculation Tests
- ✅ Basic item with 10% VAT: PASS
- ✅ Item with discount and VAT: PASS  
- ✅ Item with explicit discount: PASS
- ✅ Document totals calculation: PASS
- **Success Rate: 100%**

### Calculation Examples
1. **Basic Item**: 10 × 100 = 1000 + 10% VAT = 1100
2. **With Discount**: 5 × 200 = 1000, 10% discount = 900, 10% VAT = 90, Total = 990
3. **Explicit Discount**: 3 × 150 = 450, 50 discount = 400, 10% VAT = 40, Total = 440

## Database Impact

### Tables Updated
- `sales_orders`: Tax amounts recalculated with 10% VAT
- `supplier_lpos`: VAT amounts updated with proper calculations
- `invoices`: Tax calculations standardized across all invoices

### Data Integrity
