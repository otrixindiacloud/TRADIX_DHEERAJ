# Tax, Discount, and Offer Calculation Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes applied to ensure accurate tax, discount, and offer calculations across the entire TRADIX application.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Sales Order Storage - Missing Tax Calculations
**File:** `server/storage/sales-order-storage.ts`

**Issues Found:**
- Tax calculations were hardcoded to 0 in multiple places
- No discount calculations implemented
- Missing proper financial totals calculation

**Fixes Applied:**
- Enhanced `calculateFinancialTotals()` method to include proper tax and discount calculations
- Fixed `createSalesOrder()` method to calculate taxes from item-level data
- Fixed `createSalesOrderFromQuotation()` method to include tax calculations
- Added support for both percentage and fixed amount discounts
- Implemented proper rounding for financial calculations

**Before:**
```typescript
// For now, no tax calculation - can be enhanced later
const taxAmount = 0;
const totalAmount = subtotal + taxAmount;
```

**After:**
```typescript
const grossAmount = quantity * unitPrice;
const discountAmount = explicitDiscountAmount > 0 ? explicitDiscountAmount : (grossAmount * discountPercent / 100);
const netAmount = grossAmount - discountAmount;
const taxAmount = netAmount * taxPercent / 100;
```

### 2. Supplier Quote Storage - Missing Tax Calculations
**File:** `server/routes/supplier-quotes-new.ts`

**Issues Found:**
- Tax calculations were missing in quote creation
- Only basic subtotal calculation was implemented

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added comprehensive tax and discount calculations
- Implemented proper item-level calculations
- Added support for both percentage and fixed amount discounts
- Enhanced total amount calculation to include taxes

**Before:**
```typescript
totalAmount = subtotal; // Add tax calculation if needed
```

**After:**
```typescript
const grossAmount = quantity * unitPrice;
const discountAmount = explicitDiscountAmount > 0 ? explicitDiscountAmount : (grossAmount * discountPercent / 100);
const netAmount = grossAmount - discountAmount;
const itemTax = netAmount * taxPercent / 100;
totalAmount = subtotal + totalTax;
```

### 3. Currency Calculation Utilities - Already Working Correctly
**File:** `client/src/lib/currency-utils.ts`

**Status:** ✅ Already properly implemented
- Accurate line item calculations
- Proper document-level aggregation
- Correct rounding to 2 decimal places
- Support for both percentage and fixed amount discounts
- Proper tax calculations on net amounts

### 4. LPO PDF Generation - Already Fixed
**File:** `server/routes/supplier-lpo.ts`

**Status:** ✅ Already properly implemented (from previous VAT fix)
- Correct VAT calculations from item-level data
- Proper discount handling
- Accurate totals calculation
- Fixed PDF generation to show correct amounts
